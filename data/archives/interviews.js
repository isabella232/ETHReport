There’s vocal people who don’t have good ideas; there’s a lot of noise. </p><p>To improve: committee-based approach (reputable stakeholders from reputable projects who get together?). </p><p>Problems are getting solved at the wrong abstraction level. </p><p>E.g. NFT standards. </p><p>Neufund was largest Solidity project before –– tokenized equity. </p><p>You want a EuroToken. You don’t want your company valuated in Ether. </p><p>What if blockchain forks; which token is actually tied to the company? </p><p>Bounty approach gives many different styles within the codebase. </p><p>This is a problem; e.g. OpenSSL codebase after Masters / PhDs.</p>',
        'Who are you and what are you working on?': '<p>0x - Decentralized exchange protocol. It is a set of smart contracts that handle standard transactions in an order format. </p><p>The key advantage here is that these smart contracts leads to shared liquidity </p><p>We also achieve increased security and network liquidity through our architecture. </p><p>We launched the network in August 2017. </p><p>It works, but is V1. We are working on V2 which helps people build hybrid stations, supports new token standards, and makes the contract more gas efficient. </p><p>V1 only allows humans to create orders; V2 will allow new smart contract to create orders. This is HUGE. </p><p>Notes: </p><p>We’re building the protocol; designing the standard; building dev tools for anyone to build a decentralized exchange. </p><p>Orders may become invalid for any reason: </p><p>Order being filled </p><p>Griefing attacks </p><p>We’ve now built an OrderWatcher that keeps relayers updated on the state of orders. </p><p>We’re using contract Events as a proxy for state changes. </p><p>Can do a diff between state trees and between block headers. </p><p>We also have a set of smart contracts to handle settlement; </p><p>Everyone who wants to trade is setting allowances on a smart contract. </p><p>We want upgradability.</p>',
        'What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?': '<p>EthereumJS / truffle hardwallet provider / Typedoc (to generate documentation) / </p><p>We don’t use Truffle anymore </p><p>Not reliable – can have race conditions; </p><p>Artifacts don’t allow you to have versions of the contract on different networks </p><p>You don’t run into this stuff if you’re just building a “hello world” </p><p>Overwriting parts of the contracts; </p><p>We rolled our own. It’s open-source but not documented. We have other things that are keeping us busy. </p><p>The problem is that Truffle has too much functionality –– we would like to see more of a Unix philosophy. </p><p>Cannot support different versions of Solidity. </p><p>Version management doesn’t exist. </p><p>EthPM –– doesn’t have versioning either? It’s going through a big refactor, so we held off. We need the NPM package manager. </p><p>We have built a lot of developer tools to interface with the smart contracts ourselves. </p><p>We have also built own deployer and migration tool, as truffle’s did not suit our needs.</p>',
        'What are your biggest frustrations?': '<p>Getting a simple experimental environment up is hard </p><p>Remix is there; but it’s not enough. </p><p>Tracing and profiling is not existent. </p><p>Remix does it, but can’t do it locally. </p><p>“Code coverage” tool exists but inserts console.logs in </p><p>Adding up gas costs per line of code. </p><p>Need to do profiling, because gas costs depend on inputs. </p><p>Solidity language itself: </p><p>Crashed the Solidity compiler twice today. </p><p>E.g. AbiEncoderV2 is pretty new and hard to understand/use. </p><p>The code that it produces is inefficient. </p><p>There is a stark stack limit in solidity </p><p>All the variables are locally scoped. </p><p>Un-intuitive as it is a curly braced language. </p><p>The lifecycle hook value_of is within a function. </p><p>Can only access top 16 slack slots. Including input and output. </p><p>We need to implement a graph coloring register allocator – to find out what the lifetime of the variables is. </p><p>“This stack slot was used in the first half –– the second half you can use” </p><p>Or implement register splitting. </p><p>Function inlining is frustrating sometimes: </p><p>E.g. SafeMath –– turns every operator into function call – which is a huge gas sink. </p><p>How Solidity optimizes could be improved: </p><p>It focuses on the code size (which makes sense since it’s minimizing the state tree); but sometimes you need to optimize size of tx gas (e.g. 0x needs optimized fillOrder call) </p><p>ABI doesn’t implement introspection </p><p>EIP 165 </p><p>E.g. “does this contract implement ERC20, or ERC223?” </p><p>Solidity should have this in-built. </p><p>Should be built into the API spec and compiler. </p><p>Inheritance: </p><p>Interface or abstract contract – e.g. Solidity automatically creates getters for state functions –– collides with </p><p>Contract which implements an interface – public or external for abstract functions – they collide </p><p>ERCs – there is not a formal way to describe the interface for contracts. </p><p>Have a standard repo –– this will lead to a canonical ABI definition –– can have semantic rules around this. Could run some specific unit tests against</p>',

Did not have too much stuff in it really: simple formatting, definitions, highlighting. Not “a super interesting” project, but has 36 000 users (some duplicates). </p><p>VMs </p><p>Been wanting to speed up tests recently. Bottleneck is code execution in Ganache VM (90%).

        'Other domain specific questions?': '<p>What has your experience been like working on EIPS? </p><p>Working on EIP 712 - signing structured and typed data </p><p>Quite hard with monetary prospects and no established legislation process - need better ways of governing and enforcing the process. </p><p>Really helped to have everyone in one room at ETHDenver and align on angles of attack. </p><p>Room at ETHDenver from commenting on a thread in GH. Started unstructured and moved into structured discussion by defining the interface, which helped identify all the different parties’ motivations. This revealed some inertia on some teams’ behalf, which was interesting to see. </p><p>Lot of discussions about metadata (of tokens, which is also important for other parts of tokens) </p><p>GH PRs are one single wall of text and the comments need to be better moderated, especially for trolls or tangential discussions/ideas (especially tangential ideas need to be collapsed). </p><p>Creators need to moderate/create a TL;DR section to help people better and more easily grasp what they are working on. </p><p>Solidity code coverage - how does that work? </p><p>Before each line calling eval, and modifying Eth and ganache code to read the events, much below the current block gas limit and working through everything that comes through. </p><p>Take debug transaction with list of opcodes. Also have the source maps, which map back from opcodes to lines of solidity code, and can use that the work backwards from opcodes to understand exactly which line used how much gas. </p><p>How do you get the trace after each tx? </p><p>We wrote our own provider, whenever call to eth_sendTransaction gone through provider it sends it and then gets the trace. </p><p>Calls don’t have traces though, so need to do a snapshot and then send the call as a tx, which gives you the trace back and then you can look at what happened in the call. </p><p>Did look at other tools, but felt the performance and reliability of those tools just kinda sucked. </p><p>Can you tell us more about Event Watching? </p><p>Lacking good open source project[a] </p><p>People don’t have stateful nodes, you need to handle events client side </p><p>Ethereum-js blockstream enables us to use stateless nodes after installing all filters. Still not a part of web3. </p><p>Working on something called order-watcher: track when the order becomes invalid. Which happens when the user manipulates things. You can validate reactively by watching for events, but you want to actually watch balance changes and events are just an imperfect proxy for this. </p><p>People can mint and burn tokens and change balance without emitting events. </p><p>Want to track changes in balances, not events. balanceOf() is view function that returns the balance, so we want to track the result of calling that. </p><p>Might be inefficient to look at that directly, or we can register callbacks and recompute only when the state used by that function changes. </p><p>But how do we know when state changes? </p><p>Cannot rely on solidity, but can run function, get trace, see which storage slots the function is reading, and then you for sure know that this function will only change its value when one of those storage slots changes. </p><p>Use Patricia tries somehow to watch these storage slots and state changes - allow you to watch efficiently changes on view and pure functions. </p><p>Check out EIP 781: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/781 </p><p>Can you tell us more about ABI gen for statically typed contracts? </p><p>Contracts need to be checked at compile times to ensure parameters etc (strong instead of number or something like that) and being statically typed is much easier to check this. </p><p>Inspired by geth tooling, and there are also some JS ones (salt-size etc) but were all very opinionated and made all sorts of assumptions about how you wanted to use your contracts. </p><p>With 0x tool: Consensys is using it, Sybil (journalism tools, also with typescript contracts). </p><p>Using ethers.js for backend of contracts due to issues with web3 versions (classic). </p><p>Best ideas to have in a debugger? </p><p>Not writing solidity actively at the moment and I haven’t used one yet because it is such a high level tool (haha). </p><p>I feel that this is quite a long way away right now. </p><p>Need bytecode, source code, source maps, traces, interruptable VM etc. </p><p>Can you tell us more about signing data in Ethereum? </p><p>Arbitrary string that people were supposed to sign, but then people figured that you could use it to send ETH, hence the weird prefix that got implemented - not an EIP, it is just a bugfix. </p><p>If there is a way to display user data and get them to understand the transaction fully, then they would surely not sign. Prefix doesn’t solve anything, it just postpones the problem.</p>',

Instead of people and money, normal OSes manage CPU and RAM etc. </p><p>Two key pieces to this sort of work: </p><p>Controlling money. </p><p>Controlling permissions. </p><p>We also provide a lot of UI components on top of the contracts that we are writing. </p><p>The entire goal of 0.5 (live on Rinkeby now) is to allow people to easily create and manage their own organisation, along with granular permission and financial management. </p><p>Should be able to create their own application to live in their organisations: and this is where we imagine the network of organisations will emerge from. </p><p>Hooking up your own apps, and designing your own interfaces to handle certain complex behaviour</p>',
        'What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?': '<p>Four categories: </p><p>EVM and lower level stuff: </p><p>A lot of our problems have been solved by solidity 0.5 pragma </p><p>Revert with reason! Should be better for error logging. </p><p>Dynamically-sized parameters inside the EVM. We did not have an opcode before Byzantium that could have handled returndatasize with dynamically-sized stuff. </p><p>We play a lot with assembly and ABIEncoding has really bugged us before inside Solidity. So when, for eg, we want to stuff dynamic arrays with mock call data sent through delegatecalls. We have to do some funny business to properly encode them, and 0.5 exposes tooling to do this automatically. </p><p>Smart contracts: </p><p>Not a lot of great tools here yet, especially around testing. This seems to be a fairly obvious hole. </p><p>Not a big fan of Truffle, even though everyone seems to use it. It is especially slow when compiling. </p><p>Solc can be installed directly on most distros, and does stuff in less than 1s, whereas solcjs will take 20s, so why would you go for the latter? </p><p>Dapphub has their own set of nix-based tools that I haven’t tried yet, and really want to. But the barrier to understanding here if you don’t come from the right programming background is very high. </p><p>We use a bunch of standard libraries like Open Zeppelin, and the MiniMeToken and some other cool code that tends to fly around on GitHub or Reddit in the right places. However, this is a tricky place right now, because Package Management is unclear and no-one is yet sure if they want to use ETHPM. </p><p>There is a lot of people copy-paste contracts into their own repos, which isn’t great. It would be better to see them moved between repos with commit hashes and proper referencing. </p><p>We do this, as it is especially helpful for auditiability. </p><p>Dev tooling that allows people to easily build aragon applications: </p><p>It’s tough to develop Ethereum applications right because there are a lot of things you need to spin up yourself. </p><p>Deploy a local chain, deploy your contracts onto it, and then only with that done can you start building a UI linked to that chain. </p><p>Not too bad if you have just a few contracts, but with the way that Aragon has been designed (esp in term of flexibility) there are a lot of components that need to be deployed on chain before it all begins to work. </p><p>ENS on local chain, APM, base logic contracts, factories to extend the proxies on top of those basic contracts, and then only do we have a good chain state for people to hook up a UI against. </p><p>This produces a lot of friction, both internally and externally, so we have this goal to simplify it all. </p><p>Ganache has a snapshotting feature where it will dump the entire chain state (the whole patricia trie into a bunch of JSON files) that can then be used to start up your own chain from that state. </p><p>However, when you tell Ganache to run from the snapshot, if you do anything on the chain, it overwrites everything. </p><p>So you actually need two snapshots and some patience to get things right. </p><p>We also need to deploy things onto IPFS, which adds another barrier for users wanting to get going with local development. </p><p>So, we have tried to build this command into aragon-cli, called “aragon run” that handles everything for you. </p><p>Based on the brittleness of tooling though, it’s very difficult to make this reliable, and get it to error gracefully and debug why it isn’t working when it fails. </p><p>UI: </p><p>Not too much in terms of Ethereum-related tooling - a lot is just normal, front-end javascript. </p><p>Major frustration is web3.js. There are just so many things wrong with that package… “Every day is new adventure when using web3”. </p><p>Pretty much every time we have had to do something for a deadline, we have run into issue with it that have delayed us. </p><p>i.e. in Buenos Aires, we wanted a mainnet launch for our Survey App, for which we need websockets and https. </p><p>We set Parity up with secure websockets on our own node and launched our UI and web3 just doesn’t connect to secure websockets. So what was the problem? </p><p>Took some hours to play with all the different settings before realising that the latest version of web3 doesn’t support websockets. Downgrading then works, but the previous package didn’t have some other functions we needed. </p><p>Relied on getting events to process changed information in the UI. However, the event handler in one particular version of the package would send some events in the error callback as opposed to the actual one and we were totally baffled how that could even be.</p>',
        'What are your biggest frustrations?': '<p>My biggest general frustration comes with the relative youth of the whole industry, which underlies a lot of our collective frustration, including both security and development. </p><p>It feels like we sometimes have our hands and feet tied when we are trying to make something. When you make a typical web app, there is a lot of freedom in tooling and the tooling is robust. </p><p>You can make changes easily, watch these changes propagate, feel productive, and get feedback immediately. </p><p>This is not the case on Ethereum - things that should take a day actually take a week or a month. </p><p>Estimation of time is really difficult, but especially in Ethereum given how many unknown unknown there are. </p><p>It’s really easy to get started, but it gets harder and harder to maintain. </p><p>Now that we have a lot of stuff built out, we now have to maintain it, and that decreases the rate at which we can ship new features as there is a lot of old architecture you need to deal with. </p><p>Feels like we’re playing a lot more defense than offence. Was first introduced to this by Jon Choi: you should be proactively pursuing offense and limiting defense (i.e. innovation over optimization). </p><p>All of these tools that are “not quite robust” tend to waterfall a lot, which means we are consistently on the defense, even against the tools we’re using. </p><p>No teams are really at the level of engineering that we need to be at. It’s all shooting from the hip right now, which we fall into too because we want to ship things quickly. </p><p>There are no really great patterns or best practices or frameworks to follow just yet, or at least a shortage of them in the ecosystem. </p><p>Every year in traditional ecosystems, a new testing framework will come out, which is really great and I would love to see a similar situation beginning to happen in the Ethereum world.</p>',
        'How do you handle testing?': '<p>In addition to the above we also use solidity-coverage, which can be super painful too. Not sure if the most recent version has fixed some of the issues, as we haven’t yet upgraded (we pin our contracts to an older version of solc for security reasons after they have been audited with a specific compiler version). </p><p>All of the tools are tightly coupled to the solc versions they use, and this becomes an issue in general for updating tools for coverage and testing. This should take 30 mins to set up, and yet, our CI is still broken today because solidity-coverage just does not want to work.</p>',

Building on top of, rather than within, the EVM you need to update the toolset you’re using and this becomes really difficult with the current tools. </p><p>If you implement some different opcodes in solidity, you need to take them all the way up. Open source is great, but it needs to be easy to fork and re-implement it easily in order for it to be really powerful. </p><p>Talk to person who had to modularise Truffle internally (not just testing, but also the lack of modularity - if you want to change something and still talk to others in the space, the best solution is often to rewrite the whole tool yourself, which is less than ideal). Aidan to send intro to David about this. </p><p>Parity and Geth </p><p>Also speak with David and Greg. </p><p>Use Parity due to responsiveness from the community and how good they are at answering questions!!! Great community - so NB!! Aidan’s biggest asset is his network of core community members, which really matters in decentralized communities - open channels of communication. </p><p>Rust is a more obscure language and people lack experience, hence geth is somewhat easier to use and troubleshoot. </p><p>Geth has a bigger community, but the actual people developing the client aren’t as readily available as Parity. </p><p>MetaMask for frontend development </p><p>Were tasked with making MM work for client and had to rebuild a lot of the stuff. Will also send an intro to the dev who handled. Greg is his name. </p><p>Mythril </p><p>Huge frustrations with this tool. Getting it running is a pain in the ass. </p><p>If it could be applied at the stack layer and not the smart contract layer. Build something like Mythril for an EVM implementation, trace things up the stack cleanly, add/remove opcodes, make new instructions. A stack explorer so to speak. </p><p>Could spawn so many things because we could understand the stack in a better way and grab a lot more logic. Pity to see focus on higher level tools, which has become somewhat of a hindrance. Why hyperledger went out and did it themselves (not just the licensing issues). </p><p>Educational tool for stupid web devs like me to learn about how opcodes actually work and are composed in the EVM. </p><p>Regular rust and node related stuff (also some go stuff). </p><p>Are there tools from these arenas that don’t exist in Ethereum which would be really cool? </p><p>We need to make these tools more closely aligned with the chain itself. With WASM coming online, this is already happening and we just need to be ready - i.e. teach everyone WASM. </p><p>The end if here for really high-level development with WASM. What this will mean for the community and internet in general has yet to be discussed completely. </p><p>Try to use ethers.js as much as possible as opposed to web3 </p><p>The person developing these tools (Richard) is totally accessible, responds to issues immediately (faster than a bot!!) - he is so collaborative and wants to make sure everyone is using the best tools possible, and this all makes such a difference. </p><p>Polymath people doing off-chain signing, which you couldn’t do at the time and 1 of the methods didn’t have a response variable they needed, and by the next morning it was updated. Tight feedback loops make it so much better to use tools. </p><p>You can create your own wallet in 4 LOC in your terminal - again the language and syntax is so much easier for a non-dev that this solution ought to win in the long time. Very relatable and understandable code base. </p><p>Gave solidity and parity/EVM workshops: </p><p>EVM workshop: took instructions, showed how it would be passed onto stack, where things go, how it gets passed on to memory. Questions were so relevant and knowledgeable. </p><p>Whereas in the solidity workshop, the questions were much more absurd and irrelevant. Talking about the stack, people from a dev background get it. It just makes sense. Take away: if we want devs who have been developing for 20 years, we need to actually show them how the stack works. </p><p>This is a community-wide failure that we need to focus on - for someone with a CompSci degree, solidity is crazy, but the stack is not!! </p><p>Bounty for cleaning up the yellow paper. Speak with David about this and his more in-depth version of the yellow paper. </p><p>Only ever hindered by delivering work because of MetaMask. Event and event monitoring between different networks was a fix that took a long time to be fixed. They have updated since and we haven’t done any more work there since.</p>',

We need a more full-fledged local client. </p><p>We haven’t really prepared for how to handle contracts across shards (coming months to years, who knows?). </p><p>We are looking mostly at tools to support the WASM architecture. This is likely the problem that will take the most of our time, I think. I have talked to Johan Barbie about this and I’m not sure anyone has a very good solution for what a tool that would help scheme the interactions out actually looks like. </p><p>I am personally more worried about language design stuff, and languages in general, than I am about the consensus layer, or anything below the language and application layer. </p><p>We are also working hard on updating our tools to support, for instance, Vyper.

This goes back to the need for better visual tools, in my opinion. </p><p>A lot of contracts do not acknowledge that they are operating in a resource-constrained environment. For instance, I see lots of loops - which is not a desirable thing when operating on top of Ethereum. </p><p>People also don’t have that “asynchronous mindset”, unless you have been working with a very strange stack indeed. Even people coming from JS and pure node backgrounds - it’s not quite the same thing. </p><p>They keep favouring push mechanism when there should be a pull one (or vice versa). </p><p>In reality, this is a very hard question. I do have a collection of very specific stuff I have seen people do wrong, but - in a very general manner - the biggest problem is bringing synchronous patterns into smart contracts. </p><p>Thinking of a way to have them do otherwise, this whole thing is promoted by people not getting what is actually happening beneath their code.

Now it’s set to latest stable, so don’t get immediate feedback. </p><p>Truffle and etc only upgrade manually – so its more stable – but slows down the feedback / dev cycle. </p><p>How would this work: </p><p>“Reminder: people please try out new versions.” </p><p>Way to give feedback exists: creating an issue on Github OR their Gitter channel. </p><p>Most people can’t use the latest the version – because the toolset doesn’t allow it. </p><p>As part of the CI, we’re running some tests with specific libraries. </p><p>Possible solution: </p><p>People submit their contracts to Solidity team. </p><p>They get integrated into their CI pipeline – every time a new version is pushed, their contract tests are run. </p><p>We get contacted if tests pass re new version working. </p><p>Tools for developing Solidity </p><p>It’s written in cpp, we usually cmake toolchain for building, cpp-ethereum for semantic tests; thinking about switching to their own interpreter to speed up tests. </p><p>Uses cpp-ethereum with a few extra RPC endpoints.

        'Who are you and what are you working on?': '<p>I was a security professional, doing consulting, came into Ethereum a couple of years ago solving bounties for VMs. </p><p>October 2016 - became Head of Security at The Foundation. </p><p>Monitoring mainnet. </p><p>Being able to react when there is a consensus flaw. Had an API call to geth, called getBadBlocks. Geth will save bad blocks and you can query node for it. </p><p>So, we run geth and parity simultaneously. Ask parity node for last block, ask geth for bad blocks, If they match, can see more easily why and who might have acted badly. </p><p>But can’t do it vice versa - been nagging Parity to add that end point so we can do the same process in reverse. </p><p>Geth client has a lot of metrics: how many i/o connections, db writes, block processing times, peer connects. Can export from geth and display in any charting you like. So, that’s exactly what we do; get nice graphs about tx churn, how txes were rejected, queued, pooled. </p><p>Optimizations in geth which made block processing faster in the past month. You can also monitor for performance, not just security... </p><p>Shanghai attacks taught us that performance very much related to security. </p><p>P2P network information, protocol dissector / analyzer -- if I can see what is happening on my node and what my peer capabilities are, what have they seen, etc.  Is there any one peer that is sending me transactions that I reject? That way, I can identify bad behaving or lying peers (more in-depth view of what people are telling me over the network) </p><p>Would be difficult as an add-on (need node keys, decrypt data, etc.),  Much simpler to do within a client.  Protocol layer in Geth. </p><p>Build tools for analysis, especially when things are going wrong: hacks, network problems. </p><p>E.g. transaction propagation when network was overloaded with txes going back &amp; forth between parity and Geth. </p><p>Needs for lots of testing around hard forks as the existing tools were not sufficient to cover all cases. </p><p>Coverage guided fuzzing - generate code and run on instrumented version of Geth / Parity. This matches code coverage, generates new code and increases coverage using fuzz tactics to mutate inputs and can test geth and parity differentially. Do they have the exact same stuff in the stack, in memory etc.? </p><p>Another fuzz testing tool based on EVM Lab that can generate tests for CPP ethereum and can cover py-ethereum etc by running in docker container with a switch that enables an output after every opcode and compare internal state differentially again. Run this 24/7. </p><p>Caught 5-6 consensus issues with this. Last hard fork was a controversy as Parity had done a whole bunch of releases prior to the hardfork and the suggestion was to postpone, which would have caused its own issues and forced clients to update again. </p><p>If patched before hard fork - no problem. Beat the drums and tell everyone to upgrade. </p><p>If you find a consensus issue on an existing client it is a bit more problematic.Telling everyone means giving people the chance to exploit it - tough to handle. </p><p>Examples of consensus issues: make a tx which invokes a precompile like verify_signature and if that, in one case returns true and in another returns false, or if they cost different amounts of gas (i.e. x on geth and y on parity) then post-state will be different so they won’t accept the same blocks and then we have a fork. </p><p>There was a consensus issue that happened after Spurious Dragon when we implemented state cleaning. Chain split for 200 blocks, which were created on the wrong chain that were then abandoned. Block 2 600 000 or so. </p><p>Developers need to be alerted as soon as possible so they can fix it ASAP. People can lose money in the meantime, txes can be reverted. All exchanges need to be alerted to hold deposits and withdrawals. </p><p>Have built tools to detect this, so we consider it solved from a technical p.o.v. </p><p>Recommend that exchanges run all clients, but not sure if they do. Could be standardised with docker containers that could be more streamlined. Documentation around best practices, automated tooling etc. </p><p>Building something like Ethstats but more detailed. If there is a consensus failure, you might want to see exactly which tx in which block caused it. Nice to see blocks, txes and intermediate root hashes between each tx. Then you can see different post-state hash, i.e. that is where we should start looking. </p><p>Need detailed traces of exactly what happened in every opcode of this transaction. </p><p>One of the things I built in EVM Lab is a reproducer. Synthesises pre-state for that particular tx, then executes it and gives you a detailed trace from geth and parity that you can then compare. </p><p>Not much active development on EVM Lab. Use it mainly for investigating certain condition or opcode or potential attack. Pretty easy to put together desired scenario in an EVM assembly-like way by setting genesis you want and then run &amp; benchmark it. </p><p>It is usable right now and I have no immediate plans to do anything in the near term. Might need some updates and it is not so user friendly.[a] </p><p>One of core devs for go-ethereum. </p><p>We want to expand - have 2 interns now, but had to turn someone away recently too. Send interested developers to Peter. </p><p>Working a lot with the signer, which was just merged in latest release. Standalone binary which can run off some secure enclave, USB armoury, parallel VM, some other machine on your network. Can be used for offline signing and has trusted UI. </p><p>Can be configured with particular rules written i.e. in JS. Definitely needs more work on the UI. has implemented one in python-qt and python-cleft. Can also be run in a console, with remote ports etc so you can decouple pvt keys from your daily computer. </p><p>Hoping MetaMask will integrate with it directly. Has spoken with Dan and another guy called Jordan building a tool called (?) which has integrated it already. </p><p>Hard problem: how to make it more secure for end users. Surf internet with unpatched browsers with 0 days and they get exploited. How can we improve upon that so that you have a sign what you see flow. Submit a tx, see the details of that tx when you approve it. </p><p>Unlock feature is most horrible thing he has seen where it will sign every tx sent to it for a given period. </p><p>I don’t do too much DApp development, so I’m not up to speed with capabilities of current tools and how they have matured over the last 6-8 months. </p><p>I have heard there is a debugger out now which I remember as being one of the main pain points.</p>',

Don’t try to do crazy things. </p><p>For the first time, we’re mixing two things that haven’t been mixed together: </p><p>The two: </p><p>Critical code – contracts holds money. </p><p>Open-source – everyone can see how it works. </p><p>E.g. you don’t have this in planes – critical program but not open-source. </p><p>E.g. in a website – it could be open-source but not critical. </p><p>So you realize you need to write perfect code, but that’s not possible. Because code is written by humans. </p><p>It’s important to improve: </p><p>Do not take risks. </p><p>Try to isolate the critical part. E.g. if you’re doing an ICO, don’t hold the ETH in the contract, instead put it directly into the multisig. </p><p>Minimize the box, with its known security vectors. </p><p>On one side, you have a blockchain that by definition that is immutable. On the other side, immutable is not compatible with making mistakes. </p><p>Humans make mistakes. We are building things on top of that immutable base that could have mistakes. </p><p>But we need to keep blockchains immutable, because if don’t, we lose their power. </p><p>How do we solve this? </p><p>Possible approach is having a second layer –– instead of ETH, we use an ETHToken. ETHToken has governance built in and can be modified. You build it in a more centralized manner, it can be changed; and then overtime, you soften the centralization rules, and make it decentralized (take away the authority, make it operated by a DAO, etc). </p><p>E.g. having an escape hatch would be super helpful. If there is a hack, it could be sent to the EF or whitehat group. And then you can decide what to do. Better than it going directly to a hacker. </p><p>And then you can build the smart contract applications on this second layer. </p><p>Want to make decentralization linear; so you don’t have to take the risks from the beginning. </p><p>All contracts in Giveth have escape hatches built in. </p><p>STANDARD LIBRARY for using ETHToken in your contract, layer for security, escape hatches => I think it might be a bit too early though since we’re still figuring it all out.

It can be done in Ethereum on chain, but scalability, front-running and ease of use just isn’t there yet (need everyone participating and having a global liquidity pool). </p><p>Dutch exchange implemented on chain to solve front running problems. </p><p>Integrating with USD price feed of Maker - was a little hard to depend on other people’s infrastructure and therefore the tests that they have deployed. We ended up mocking their service for test net, would have been awesome to just point at their package, specify a contract on either network and go without having to mock any of the other services. </p><p>Make sure that things like ETHPM are deployed across all test networks. </p><p>Also built the multisig wallet for our own token launch, has been very successful and we now want to offer the same experience for every user: more secure wallets for personal use that are even better than hardware wallets.</p>',

Not well optimized at all. </p><p>If you access a storage variable twice, you will always have to pay twice, rather than optimizing to keep it in memory - very annoying in the end. Means you have to do a lot of gas optimisations yourself which really should be automatic. </p><p>These kind of issues require domain expertise - why don’t we all put up a $1 million bounty for a new smart contract language/compiler.[a] </p><p>Might be interesting to keep it lower level, something similar to Vyper with the much simpler bytecode and cheaper execution, better verification etc. We cannot have only one smart contract language. </p><p>Using truffle framework because it is most used framework and want their codebase to be as approachable as possible. </p><p>Debugging is an absolute pain in the ass - even truffle’s debugger is not great. No easy breakpoints, difficult to step through easily, or change variable to run different kinds of tests. </p><p>Would be better to statically typed testing environment - only test framework in JS (python one is not maintained). We need another framework that can go deeper and be more precise. </p><p>Web3 itself really sucks. </p><p>API versioning for ethereum json-rpc stuff. No versioning, no documentation, no proper error codes. Plenty of useful calls that are missing, plenty of calls that exist that no-one uses and it’s just chaos in general. We have to assume what version is running on the user end, so have to assume they are running all kind of different versions. </p><p>Everyone using MetaMask and Infura makes this slightly more hidden. </p><p>I proposed a new json rpc call but geth ahd already implemented it, but it was documented nowhere and Parity hadn’t really thought of doing it at the time, so there is no clear way of defining what the standard is. </p><p>Was about allowing users to sign offline transactions in a specific way: ask the client to sign and return the tx data that can be then used from an offline location. </p><p>We need a test suite against the json-rpc API: just to test that Geth and Parity are actually behaving in the same way. </p><p>Using Remix IDE - then go to local text editors for further dev once they are sure the contracts run well. </p><p>Would be amazing to have a properly integrated environment. Uses Atom with solidity linter. Would be great to be able to do proper debugging in that environment as well. Things work now because complexity is relatively small - but as soon as you want to integrate between projects it becomes a total mess. </p><p>Gas metering and fuzz testing in addition to break points, stepping through, and changing variables easily. </p><p>Use Mythril to check smart contract security, executions and test coverage. Aim for 100% code coverage and use solc code coverage. </p><p>Would love a tool with some basic checks (like overflows etc), but needs to be extended to do optimisations for gas efficiency, standard way to apply smart contract best practices automatically. </p><p>Map test coverage to code execution paths so that you can easily see which cases to write tests for. Something better than code coverage which only shows where you touch the line so that we can cover the most important scenarios (i.e. where things are failing).</p>',

This is amazing. </p><p>I’m switching between Solidity / Go, or Solidity / Javascript </p><p>Solidity Javascript bindings through Truffle are good. </p><p>Integrating libraries designed for cryptocurrencies with front-end apps is hard: </p><p>Bundle sizing: different behavior if you’re running in the browser or in the backend. </p><p>E.g. if you compile a contract with truffle, you get a JSON file – which has the bytecode and all this stuff beyond the ABI. </p><p>This is heavy and unused. </p><p>Crypto.js has unnecessary dependencies: </p><p>Eth.js includes an ASN.1 parser which parses digital certificates –– which isn’t needed for any crypto.js uses. </p><p>Google Chrome places a size limit (3 MB) on service workers in Incognito mode. </p><p>Bundle sizing is important – need to take out dependencies. </p><p>Standardize the interfaces for all these libraries. </p><p>E.g. a standardize library to read BIP39 seed words – across different programming languages. </p><p>Is there a Javascript API to boot a testnet, deploy contracts, and run tests against it? </p><p>For running application tests – </p><p>I want integration tests that run against Truffle easily </p><p>Having the ability to do this via Javascript is important </p><p>E.g. automate this: https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy/blob/master/run_integration_tests.sh </p><p>People don’t know how to productionize a geth node: </p><p>On Ubuntu: you can ‘apt-get install geth’ </p><p>Now, how do you secure it, monitor it, etc? </p><p>People say: “just use Infura” – but then you’re tied to Infura. </p><p>Some ideas: </p><p>Docker instances; Chef or Ansible scripts; that setup a Geth node which has a bunch of best practices around it. </p><p>As an example: </p><p>Your RPC port shouldn’t be open to the external world, but should be accessible to the front-end. </p><p>You need a layer sitting between the geth node and the external world, and gives: 1) analytics, 2) authentication, and 3) audit logging. </p><p>The dashboard could configure geth on the fly. </p><p>How do you secure a geth node with an RPC port: </p><p>Need only certain keys to be allowed to interact with it </p><p>Jacky: </p><p>Integrating Metamask with Dapps </p><p>Building a new wallet for Spank; </p><p>It’s a service worker </p><p>Three threads running at once: </p><p>Runs a bunch of background processes </p><p>The Wallet </p><p>The Dapp itself </p><p>The messaging between these three threads sucks. </p><p>Cross-window JSON RPC library. </p><p>Wallets are pushing the limits of what Chrome is capable of. </p><p>They’ve had to file two bugs with Chrome in the last month. </p><p>Runs into the service worker size limit. </p><p>Mostly Javascript and Web3 work </p><p>Lot of code repetition in loading state and confirming transactions </p><p>Web3 is kinda hard to use – large ABIs </p><p>Biggest problem has been around event management. </p><p>Key management is not that complicated – Web3 has a good handle on it. </p><p>The Web 3 interaction with the wallet: </p><p>Web3 provider talks to the blockchain – </p><p>Spank and Metamask – the provider is an instance of the ZeroClientProvider – written by the Metamask team </p><p>The ZeroClient makes all calls when there’s no key needed. When a key is needed, it calls into your codebase. </p><p>Biggest problem is around the communication of gas costs. </p><p>The UX around this. </p><p>Users pick really high or low gas costs. </p><p>There are better ways to estimate gas. </p><p>Would be nice: currency conversion utility tools. </p><p>Existing tools are pretty buggy. </p><p>ETH has many different units. </p><p>Units conversion. </p><p>Matthew: </p><p>I write all my own methods – other than lowdash where I pull specific utils out. </p><p>React / Redux. </p><p>Need a way of shoving Web3 stuff into your Redux state. </p><p>Managing the lock state of your wallet </p><p>E.g. you need the lock-state of the wallet, because the UI changes. </p><p>They written a util that queries the wallet, gets it’s lock-state, and puts it into the Redux state. </p><p>Authentication: people have public/private keypair; use this data as login. </p><p>Having a canonical way to npm install and have authentication build off of Metamask. </p><p>Nice to haves: </p><p>Typescript typing for crypto libraries. </p><p>Postgres types to manage Ethereum stuff –– addresses, wei, </p><p>Have these methods: .toFinney</p>',

Would be awesome to have am MetaMask mock - wanna launch Chrome Canary, Safari, Moz and ganache will auto inject into the page some provider that could be used to test the full flow.

If there were an ethers equivalent in Rust that would be awesome. </p><p>In terms of solidity: ABI encode and decode (not written well yet, but will be super useful) are really game changing! It should be 0.3 or 0.4 or something! </p><p>Really bad documentation, especially around nuances to do with memory or storage objects etc. </p><p>When things happen in solidity, what you can do with it is not explained well. </p><p>For instance, one thing you can do is now use returndatasize to get the output bytes from some call you make. The minimum amount of code you need is a few lines of assembly. </p><p>However, this is not well known or used. </p><p>Our whole system is based on off-chain contract, and the rules in there need to be enforced by on-chain contracts. So I need to be able to interpret arbitrary function calls based on arbitrary logic/user input. This is very hard… </p><p>We do conditional payments, and these ensure that a bunch of things  are true, and then interpret the results of a bunch of functions and then take those outputs and pay people. All of these inputs, not contracts, and it gets complicated. </p><p>There is a specific error called unimplemented_error which comes up in a few cases. The only way to figure this out is to google it and there are 3 or 4 options to pick from, which seems sloppy. </p><p>Error messages could be much more specific about WHAT is unimplemented. </p><p>Would be great to see also in the docs WHY certain things are not yet implemented. </p><p>There’s some subtleties around exactly how libraries work in solidity. Will send through more details when editing. </p><p>Would be nice to have a debug mode for events, so that they will trigger regardless of whether or not there was an error so that we can use that as a console.og </p><p>Also, there should just be a console.log ;) </p><p>If you emit an event with a dynamic struct and pass it a dynamic struct, the whole thing doesn’t make it back in the logs: it only shows the top of the event. It certainly doesn’t show the whole thing. </p><p>Whenever you hit gasLimits, you should be able to find out easily where it stopped and what line it is stopping at. </p><p>Better documentation on the assembly command sand specific example usage of them would be really good. </p><p>Breakpoints with context - these are the variables and scope etc. I will sometimes play around with delegatecall and then I don’t even know which context I am in anymore and this can block me for extended periods of time. </p><p>There’s a bunch of sneaky tactics: like keyless signatures. There is a way to generate a sig for an exact and specific kind of tx from an account whose nonce is 0, because then the create opcode gives back a deterministic address. </p><p>Please can we document this!? There should be a person on stuff who just plays around with this stuff and then documents it. </p><p>This is very serious stuff, if there were a keyless-sig library, so many other things would also be available. </p><p>Better google results for Ethereum! </p><p>More literature on how Ethereum can be used to do the things people think other blockchains are better at. </p><p>Highlight ethresear.ch and some post sthere, like one from Vitalik about businesses paying gas fees for their uses, which is EOS’ biggest argument. </p><p>Even worse, explaining plasma, where it should be feasible to have no fees at all.</p>',

If I had to guess, here’s how it might unfold: </p><p>A client team with incentive to encourage a hard fork might implement “accepting on-chain hard fork proposals with client parameters” as a way to make it easier to develop the hard fork, in a community-focused way that gives users the power of choosing future forks in general, not merely supporting their own interests. </p><p>Once one client has implemented this, they should advertise their client as the client that gives the user the most control over the fork policy that their client uses, in hopes to either steal users to that client, or pressure other client developers to relinquish their own privileged decision making position by implementing support for the same. </p><p>There will probably be a friction period, either where some client devs don’t want to support this feature (either out of conviction or seeing it as a waste of time, since they may not want or need any hard forks), and so it might come down to people who have the most at stake (for example, people hoping for a funds recovery) to fund the development of this general feature for all clients. </p><p>If core client developers aren’t interested in supporting user-chosen hard fork policies, and refuse to review/merge these PRs, that might be a good reason to fork those clients, with hopes to merge after the changed version is proven stable. </p><p>IMO, any client not favorable to a user configured fork choice rule is entrenching their own power, and informed users should flock away from those clients as other alternatives emerge.</p>',

        'What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?': '<p>From an IDE perspective: Tried to use Remix, but not so easy to set up locally. No finalized IDE. It’s powerful but not easy to set up, very complicated to set up and not so stable. </p><p>Web3.js Intense users, but don’t like how they handle callbacks. New documentation is not yet complete. Want more examples on web3.js. Better documentation. </p><p>OpenOSTBase- a bunch of wrappers around the websockets around web3, make these more reliable and redundant. In production, things tend to break but this helps with that. Happy to contribute back :) </p><p>Web3.js is a first level API. First layer access to the technology, but want to have a more user friendly second layer that caters to the community needs. More user friendly, without having to do the same thing several times. We want a second level API, a helper or utility level API. </p><p>What tools don’t exist at the moment? </p><p>Haven’t super explored Ganache but is interested in more things done via command line. Any type of automation that can be done from the command line is cool and greatly helps with efficiency. </p><p>Biggest thing we are missing is an IDE suited for the ecosystem. Something that could do a gas function on Remix done on runtime, you could see security things happening on runtime. Integrating Remix with a different IDE, it’s currently statically bound. </p><p>Clear explanation in Documentation. </p><p>General level: a big proponent of multiple chain universes. In OST users only really interact with Ethereum mainnet, only have tooling directed towards one chain. </p><p>Solidity perspective, have a diagram based solution to see all the connections. Solidity codebase diagram module would be very compelling. </p><p>How do you handle smart contract verification and security? </p><p>Guiding principles: observe standards and don’t invent funny ways of doing things. Trying to reduce code to smaller components and go from there. Had 3 security auditors. Cure53 reviewed contracts and all traditional architecture. Zeppelin did audit for smart contracts. </p><p>Now working on the hardcore protocol. TrailOfBits builds a lot of interesting tools examining the bytecode. This is not an easy task. Trying to take very small steps one at a time and then go from there is the philosophy. </p><p>They are excited about ewasm. They respect work done with Solidity, but bytecode is the biggest thing. They have compiled with same Solidity on Mac and Linux for same thing and got different bytecode, this is a big concern. </p><p>Compiler, assembly tools, and debug tools are all major points of interest. Could be interesting if Solidity compiles to wasm, then you have portability. </p><p>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum? </p><p>To set up the first private network was somewhat difficult. Didn’t use Truffle, just Geth. Geth is very powerful but is missing good documentation and had to Google. </p><p>Solidity is good but needs better docs and better exampling. Very happy with CryptoZombies tutorials, want to see more things like this to help intro new users into the space. </p><p>Hardest thing when you deploy something is deploying a smart contract that intends to have value but not having a way to walk it back. In the last weeks running up until their deployment, did 8 dry tests with a self-destruct button. Ran this 8 times on Ropstein testnest, and then mainnet. Very interested in smart tooling to help in this process! </p><p>More tooling for testing of deployment. Testing where deployment happened properly to avoid situations like Parity Wallet. Had Monex with EthPM like tool. Scripting the deployment. Testing the deployment, could be a part of an automation toolset. Like fastlane for ios and android deployment. </p><p>What are you most excited about in the short term? </p><p>Getting OST to version 1.0 :) But beyond that most excited about ewasm. Also excited about Whisper and Swarm.</p>',

As they become more saturated, they will tend to report more false positives. </p><p>At the receipt level, the logsBloom are probably under-utilized (that is, they could hold more information without a large increase in false positive rate). </p><p>These two factors tend to make the logsBloom field both less effective than it could be and at the same time require more storage than they need to. </p><p>I wrote about this here. </p><p>Furthermore, the bloom filters exclude certain ‘addresses’ that, if they were included, would allow us to implement an RPC entry point called ‘eth_listAddressesInBlock(bn)’. This would be a compromise between a full index of addresses per block and re-scanning every trace for addresses if one wanted to build a list of transactions per address (which one would want to do if one wanted to audit a smart contract for example). </p><p>What QuickBlocks does: Do not store either the block level nore the receipt level blooms from the raw data. Instead, at each block, build an enhanced bloom filter which (1) includes every address involved in the block including those used as ‘data’ for internal transactions (ERC20 transfers and air drops), fill the bloom filters to a predetermined level (configurable, defaults to 200 bits), and when one bloom fills up, create another one at the same block. Result: significantly less storage devoted to blooms, consistent level of false positives resulting in less overall searching, ability to quickly answer ‘is this address used anywhere in this block’ with perfect fidelity. </p><p>Inefficiencies </p><p>Sept-Oct 2016 DDos transactions make requesting traces astronomically slow. I wrote about this here and here. Suggestion: easier way to identify (and skip over) dDos transactions. </p><p>When you use ‘eth_getTransactionByHash’, the RPC does not return the transaction receipt. In order to get the receipt, you must later call ‘eth_getTransactionReceipt’. You need the receipt to understand if the transaction was ended in failure. Twice as many calls to RPC than needed. Suggestion: staple the receipt to the transaction with an optional parameter to eth_getTransaction. </p><p>Transaction Error Codes prior to Byzantium Fork: </p><p>After the Byzantium Fork, getting the error status of a transaction is easy. If the ‘status’ field of the receipt is zero, then the transaction ended in error [There may be some edge cases here, we are reviewing this claim]. </p><p>Prior to Byzantium, one had to search every transaction trace looking for a trace that contains the word ‘error’. </p><p>If one is doing historical analysis prior to the Byzantium fork, or trying to gather lists of transactions per account, one has to look at every trace. </p><p>Core developers seem more focused on what’s happening at the front of the chain (understandably); rather than getting the data out of the chain. Even though getting the data out is as important. </p><p>Suggestion: It would be useful to include a status field in pre-byzantium receipts at the option of the caller of the RPC. </p><p>The need for ABI definitions </p><p>Get Solidity to make the ABI available, because it makes analysis simpler. </p><p>Get people to understand the importance of providing ABIs.</p>',

I like the style of coding you have to use - promisfying everything, every communication with EVM is done asynchronously. </p><p>VS Code locally and Remix to test contracts. </p><p>Working between them and copy-pasting between can be a real hack though.

        'What are your biggest frustrations?': '<p>Working with MetaMask and your local node/test environment is often unstable and connecting it locally can lead to strange issues that are very difficult to debug, as your contracts work fine in tests, but then fail arbitrarily in the browser. </p><p>Not having breakpoints in Solidity is hard. It would be awesome to able to see more clearly the flow of the code and follow things through the stack with some suggestions/explanations. </p><p>Last week, when deploying some contracts through Embark, it just read my contracts as interfaces and so didn’t compile them. </p><p>Not an Embark error - it comes from solc, because there was an error about the “stack being too deep” which happens when you have more than 16 local variables (which is not well documented anywhere that I know about). </p><p>The error behaviour in general is weird and difficult to follow. Better documentation around this area in particular is very much needed. </p><p>Seriously though, most of my frustrations are related to debugging.</p>',

Swarm in particular as IPFS support has been there for a long time. </p><p>Swarm has unique support for DApps and we are building some examples that use state channels and other interesting scaling solutions being developed. </p><p>These sort of example projects (well beyond SimpleStorage) allow us to put ourselves in our users’ shoes and understand what can really be done and where the pain points most often are. </p><p>Embark is planning to integrate the Remix debugger as well. </p><p>Tracking how the value associated with variable changes in the course of running specific transactions etc. is a very important feature for us. </p><p>Embark also has Whisper support, which can still be improved a lot. </p><p>Right now, we try to simplify the experience of using Whisper, but it therefore lacks some flexibility. </p><p>I am not able to specify a private key that links to a public symmetric key. E.g. when working on the gas relay node (a node-js service that subscribes to a whisper symmetric key) and we have to do it manually using the web3js library because the whisper functionality provided by Embark specifies the keys automatically and it is not currently possible to change them. </p><p>What is the gas relay node you mentioned? </p><p>It lets you perform transactions without actually holding Ether. It works by sending a signed message (through Whisper, or p2p, whatever). The signed msg is parsed by nodejs service and it will use the ETH that service has to create that transaction for you and will deduct the amount of required tokens from the account that sent the signed messaged. </p><p>It is ready to be demoed internally, but we need some additional input. </p><p>This solution needs to be included in the app, the desktop app, and perhaps even in the mailserver nodes, so requires a lot of feedback from our different teams.</p>',

        'Who are you and what are you working on?': '<p>I studied Computer Engineering and am a full stack dev. I started my career by programming web stuff and distributed systems. </p><p>A year ago I had heard a lot about BTC and “blockchain”, so I got involved. </p><p>My life goal is to build the technologies that will make people’s lives easier and more free. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies clearly can do this, but Ethereum specifically - because of the community, and the fully functional VM on a chain - is clearly the best platform we have so far. </p><p>I knew Manuel from before, and so got together with him and decided to start building some tutorials and interaction guides to walk people through the same forests I was exploring. Started contributing to Zeppelin as a security researcher, because that is the major focus at the company. </p><p>This gave a lot of background as I really had to grasp how thing happen in the EVM. You have to be incredibly conscious and attentive about the stuff you’re programming. </p><p>Auditing well-known projects also really helped me grow my knowledge of how the whole ecosystems works and what the best practices are. </p><p>I am now building Zeppelin OS - upgradable smart contracts, with a scheduler, and on chain standard libraries. </p><p>It’s a huge challenge to build this on Ethereum currently, so I became a core member and we are releasing our first version today!!</p>',
        'What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?': '<p>Truffle - I don’t really like it, but have to use it. </p><p>We can improve a lot of things here and build some more things on top of it. </p><p>Testing your contracts easily across any network and setting your own defaults through the console is not as easy as it should be. </p><p>Truffle scripts allow you to deploy your application, but the truffle environment itself is very difficult to manage, especially if you need to modify it to fit your specific project. You can lose days trying to do that. </p><p>We should start thinking about providing an interface that can be consumed, extended and used by other cmd line tools, and things like zeppelin_OS. </p><p>The testing environment is really good, but could still provide some extra features (like better debugging and changing variable easily between tests without needing to recompile everything). </p><p>I haven’t yet found one chance to run the debugger properly - but we really need that and it really needs to be easy to use. </p><p>When I try to debug my contracts on the network, I start logging events on the smart contract to see what is happening. This is really slow, it is a waste of gas and is not the way I want to handle things in the future. </p><p>We also use open zeppelin a lot in our own projects: i.e. DApps we build ourselves, and zeppelin_OS - an on chain version that can be used as a standard library for zeppelin OS. </p><p>Currently you have to deploy manually the smart contracts from our libraries that you want to use. But now, with zeppelin_OS, everyone can build a standard library that can be linked to a project that is using zeppelin_OS and everyone can use the same source code. </p><p>Say goodbye to all those deploy-time issues ;) </p><p>We use many small helper libraries: e.g. to do tricky things like testing low level calls, crafted transactions where you need to specify very small things to do with the data as an array of byte or whatever. Truffle provides no friendly way to do this, so you have to start playing with buffers of bytes and hashes and all sorts of nonsense. </p><p>Ethereumjs-abi, ethereumjs-utils etc. </p><p>Web3 is a great library. It’s very simple, though it’s been a long time that they have been promising a stable 1.0 version. </p><p>MetaMask is also really useful - makes life easier in so many ways. </p><p>We use both geth and parity as we have our own nodes to test things. </p><p>Remix is really cool and it works really well. I encourage people to use it and look forward to new releases from them. </p><p>Sharing sets/suites of contracts easily can be improved.</p>',
        'What are your biggest frustrations?': '<p>Speed of testing in Truffle is taking ~15min and it should be 1-2 at most. We need to speed that cycle up badly. </p><p>Ropsten is really slow when we need to test something in a “real” network. We have needed to cancel manually our own transactions and follow many rabbits down many different holes to figure out what happened. We need a better, more realistic testnet, for all our contracts. </p><p>You can’t set breakpoints when debugging contracts, or end-to-end transactions on the network and this can cause you to lose the whole day when you miss something as simple as a flag or a param in a contract etc. </p><p>No easy way to log things in Solidity, which makes missing the stuff above much easier than it should be. </p><p>The linter tools also take too long. It should just be possible to install and run these sorts of things without needing to do any config of your own, which is not currently the case. </p><p>Solcoverage has to be set up manually, and the docs kind of suck around this. It took us a long time to figure it all out for ourselves. </p><p>Plain solidity console/interpreter to test your contracts where you can play with the types, variables and scopes without needing to recompile everything. </p><p>Volatility of the markets - really hard to convince people to join and use the currency because of this. </p><p>Legal issues around launching companies and products are a real PITA. We need proper DAOs and soon. </p><p>Came out of web dev industry, and it is really mature. They have a lot of methodologies for running projects and organising teams. Most people in Ethereum are very young and these sort of processes are generally a mess. </p><p>There’s a lot of pressure on the back of the price, and this or that ICO and we need to make sure that the community supports and contributes to better, clearer, slower processes that actually achieve the desired goals rather than cutting corners to ship not-really-decentralized products. </p><p>We need to figure out some new processes too unique to the problems we face in crypto.</p>',
        'How do you handle testing?': '<p>We use Travis CI. </p><p>Coverall for coverage tests, also for solidity coverage using solcoverage as a plugin. Super useful to us. </p><p>Write plain mocha tests (integration and unit) and we aim for 100% coverage always. </p><p>When working on DApps we usually have standard paths to test how the UI works. </p><p>This is another developer tool that is missing: a tool to test UIs when signing transactions.</p>',
        'What tools don’t exist at the moment?': null,
        'Other domain specific questions?': '<p>Upgradable smart contracts? </p><p>We’ve been exploring many different approaches over the last year, all of them using proxies: i.e a contract using a delegateCall opcode to make things happen. </p><p>Biggest problem: we had to store information about 2 different domains, 1 of them being the proxy information and the other the contract that needs to be upgraded. </p><p>Proxy information: delegates each call to implementation contract. Storage in proxy contract, logic elsewhere, so not something new (Parity also uses this pattern). </p><p>We don’t see how upgradability works without some kind of mechanism for governance: the proxy needs to ask someone/something if the contract can/should be upgraded. This information needs to be stored as well: the “owner” and the implementation details. </p><p>The way solidity manages storage, the contract that was going to be upgraded needed to follow the storage slots where the proxy was saving the relevant information because it is important not to overwrite them. </p><p>We found a final approach that manages this very elegantly: using inline assembly to store variable and bypass the way solidity performs its own checks. We are using storage slots that solidity will never be able to access, which is how we can ensure our approaches are really safe and that we can have upgradeable smart contracts that don’t overwrite important information. </p><p>Why should we even have upgradeable though, if immutability is such a big thing? </p><p>We really don’t think upgradeability works without governance. </p><p>We have storage in one place and logic in another. So the storage actually remains immutable and will never forget what is put into it. We can modify it, but that is part of the history and you can inspect those modifications easily if you like. </p><p>We are not leaving immutability then, just handling it in a smarter way. </p><p>The idea came from exploring the strategy Solidity itself uses for mapping of variables, but with some delta to make sure Solidity won’t overwrite things.</p>',

They also have a really good team, which is always a good lense for me to assess projects through. </p><p>Neo is another interesting project.

Sometimes it feels like we’re all alone in the jungle, struggling to survive, and it would be awesome if not everyone had to feel this way going forward. </p><p>Would also be helpful to see how other companies are organising themselves on a day-to-day basis and how they collaborate with other teams, with remote workers etc.</p>'
